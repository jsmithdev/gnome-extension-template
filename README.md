# gnome-extension-template

A template for Gnome applications using web standards

Would like to work it into a yeoman generator later [https://yeoman.io/authoring/](https://yeoman.io/authoring/)

Starter application from [https://developer.gnome.org](https://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/stable/hellognome.js.html.en)
